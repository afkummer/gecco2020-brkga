## A Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm applied to the VRPTW with Skill Requirements and Synchronization Constraints

This repository contains the code of the genetic algorithm presented in [GECCO 2020 conference](https://gecco-2020.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage).

## Building the project

To be able to compile the code, you need:
- A C++17 compiler (clang >= 6.0 should be fine)
- CMake build system

To build the project, browse to the `build` directory and issue the command `cmake ..` to generate the makefile. Then, simply run `make`. By default, CMake is set to generate a debug-friendly binary, with all code optimizations disabled and all symbols embedded. To change this behavior, run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to enable the `-O2` optimization flag.

## Running the genetic algorithm

Once compiled, you should be ready to use this implementation of the BRKGA. If you execute the binary `brkga` without any arguments, it will present you the command line usage.

```bash
$./brkga
Usage: ./brkga  <1:inst path> <2:seed> <3:pop size> <4:num generations> <5:% elite> <6:% mutant> <7:% bias inherit elite>
```

Following the list of parameters, you need to specify:

- `<1: inst path>` The path to the instance file to be solved
- `<2: seed>` The seed to be set into the Pseudo-RNG
- `<3: pop size>` Number of individuals of each generation
- `<4:num generations>` Number of generations to evolve
- `<5:% elite>` Population percentage of elite individuals
- `<6:% mutant>` Population percentage of new mutants
- `<7:% bias inherit elite>` Probability to inherit an allele from the elite parent during the mating

__Note__: `<5:% elite> +  <6:% mutant> < 1.0`
__Note 2__: `<7:% bias inherit elite> < 1.0`

An example of usage is the following. This example uses 8 threads to decode the individuals. To disable multithreading, set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`.

```bash

After finishing the running, you may be interest into some of those files:

- `brkga-solutions.csv`: The solver appends to this file. It contais the progress of each execution of the `brkga` binary, with details about the best individual of each generation.
- `solution.txt`: Contains the best solution found during the search. This file is overwritten on each run of `brkga`. Its format is self-explanatory.
