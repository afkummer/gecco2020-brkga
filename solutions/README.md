## File name format

The solution files are labeled according to the number of nodes _N_,
the instance identifier _I_, and the seed _S_ used to generate such solution. 
File name pattern is `solution-N-I-S.txt`.
For example, the file `solution-200-9-8.txt` refers to the ninth instance
with 200 nodes solved with the seed 8.
